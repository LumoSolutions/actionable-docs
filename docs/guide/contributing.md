# Contributing to Actionable

Thank you for considering contributing to Actionable! We welcome contributions from the community and appreciate your help in making this package better.

## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/actionable.git
   cd actionable
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/LumoSolutions/actionable.git
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Verify your setup** by running the test suite:
   ```bash
   composer run test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Make Your Changes

1. **Write your code** following our coding standards
2. **Add tests** for any new functionality
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Ensure your code is properly formatted** and analyzed

### Quality Assurance

Before submitting your changes, ensure they meet our quality standards:

#### Code Formatting

Run Laravel Pint to format your code:

```bash
composer run format
```

This will automatically format your code according to our style guidelines.

#### Static Analysis

Run Larastan (PHPStan for Laravel) to check for potential issues:

```bash
composer run analyse
```

Fix any issues reported by the static analyzer.

#### Testing

Run the full test suite to ensure nothing is broken:

```bash
composer run test
```

All tests must pass before submitting your PR.

#### Code Coverage

Ensure your changes maintain or improve code coverage:

```bash
composer run test-coverage
```

Code coverage must be **80% or higher** as specified in our CI pipeline.

### Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: description of what you added"
```

Follow conventional commit format when possible:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Create the Pull Request

1. Go to the [Actionable repository](https://github.com/LumoSolutions/actionable) on GitHub
2. Click "New pull request"
3. Select your branch as the source and `main` as the target
4. Fill out the pull request template with:
    - **Description** of what your PR does
    - **Testing** information
    - **Breaking changes** (if any)
    - **Related issues** (if applicable)

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Target the `main` branch** for all pull requests
- **Include tests** for new functionality
- **Update documentation** if needed
- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature or fix per PR
- **Write clear descriptions** explaining what and why

## CI/CD Pipeline

Your pull request will automatically run through our CI pipeline:

### Automated Checks

1. **Code Formatting** - Laravel Pint check
2. **Static Analysis** - PHPStan/Larastan analysis
3. **Unit Tests** - Full test suite
4. **Test Coverage** - Minimum 80% coverage required

### Pipeline Requirements

All checks must pass before your PR can be merged:

- âœ… Code must be properly formatted with Pint
- âœ… Static analysis must pass without errors
- âœ… All tests must pass
- âœ… Code coverage must be â‰¥80%

You can run these checks locally to ensure they'll pass in CI:

```bash
# Format code
composer run format

# Run static analysis
composer run analyse

# Run tests with coverage
composer run test-coverage
```
